    Your job is to print a rectangle to the terminal using nested for loops. 
		This should be very similar to how you implemented a square. For example:

    *****
    *****
    *****


    should be printed if we want to print a 3x5 rectangle.

    Note: if you already know what methods are, do not create any helper
    methods to draw your objects. You can only code inside the scope of
    the "main" function
