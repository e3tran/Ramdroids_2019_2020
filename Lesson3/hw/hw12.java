/*
    hw12

    Your job is to print a diamond to the terminal using nested while loops. 
		This should be a bit more difficult than drawing a triangle. For example:

      *  
     *** 
    *****
	 ***
	  *


		should be printed if we want to print a diamond of height 5

		Note: if you already know what methods are, do not create any helper
		methods to draw your objects. You can only code inside the scope of
		the "main" function

		Hint: You want to implement this function by doing something similar to
		how you did hw11. This time, you want to draw a regular triangle on top of
		an inverted one. The same concepts apply in terms of spaces:

		ss*ss
		s***s
		*****
		s***s
		ss*ss

		assuming the s's represent spaces. 

		What makes this different though is you may only implement this using
		nested while loops. A skeleton of the code is given below. Can you figure
		out how to do the rest?

public class hw12 {
	public static void main( String[] args ) {
		while( /* TODO */ ) {
			// TODO
			while( /* TODO */ ) {
				//TODO
			}
		}
		// you may want to consider having another set of nested while loops to draw the inverted triangle
	}
}
