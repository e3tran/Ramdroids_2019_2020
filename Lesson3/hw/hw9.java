    Your job is to print a square to the terminal using nested for loops. For example:

    *****
    *****
    *****
    *****
    *****


		should be printed if we want to print a 5x5 square.

		Note: if you already know what methods are, do not create any helper
		methods to draw your objects. You can only code inside the scope of
		the "main" function
