/*
	 In this homework, you'll use if, else if, and else statements to
	 determine your power level. Fill out all TODOs. Here is the structure:
	 
	 if your power level is below 100, print out "pathetic"
	 else if your power level is 100-299, print out "heckers"
	 else if your power level is 300-799, print out "gettin powerful"
	 else if your power level is 800-2999, print out "oof"
	 else if your power level is 3000-9000, print out "youch"
	 else, print out "it's over 9000!!!"
